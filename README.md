Japanese conjugation practice web app.

It would load faster if the verbs were stored in a javascript file instead of mySQL, but I wanted to learn how to connect a web app to a database :-)

Siteground web hosting doesn't allow node.js, only php. Connection pooling between different users for the database seems difficult/impossible with only php :-(
