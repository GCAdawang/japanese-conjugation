# Japanese Conjugation Practice
A web app for practicing Japanese verb and adjective conjugations with basic spaced repition. URL: http://baileysnyder.com/jconj/

## Run locally
To run this app locally you will need to run a local http server with the "public" directory as its root. I personally use the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package from npm.
